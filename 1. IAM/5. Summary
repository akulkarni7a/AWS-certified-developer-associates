Recap:

- IAM consists of the following:
	- Users
	- Groups (A way to group our users and apply policies to them collectively)
	- Roles
	- Policy Documents (in JSON)

- IAM is universal, does not apply to regions
- Root account is the account you used to set up the AWS account -> has complete Admin access
- New users have no permissions when first created
- New users are assigned Access Key and Secret Access Key
- You can only use these keys from the command line
- Always set up Multifactor Authentication on your root account
- You can create and customize your own password rotation policies
